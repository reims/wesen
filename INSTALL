Installation help
=================


Minimum Requirements

A Windows or Unix-like (includes Linux, *BSD and OS X) operating system
If you need a GUI: OpenGL capability (loads of RAM and a fast processor will speed up a bit)
Dependencies

    * Python > 2.3.0
    * Numeric Python > 22.0
      we use numpy, not the newer numarray.
      recent versions of PyOpenGL need numarray, so if you got problems with Numeric, just install both numpy & numarray.
    * PyOpenGL > 2.0.1.0
      On Windows, you need OpenGL and GLUT.
      You can get a GLUT DLL from the Nate Robins homepage.
      Install the DLL (after extracting from a zip file) into you \$WIN\System\ folder.

Package selection

    * If you don't know what you want, choose
      wesen-0.5.tar.gz for Linux, *BSD, Mac OS X and other Unices,
      wesen-0.5.win32.exe for all Windows systems.
    * If you want documentation,
      wesen-0.4-ref.tar.gz is a packed version of help from docstrings.
    * As developer, you should use direct CVS access.
      You can browse the CVS directly via SourceForge or,
      if you experience problems, request a CVS copy by mail.
