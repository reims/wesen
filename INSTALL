Installation help
=================

Minimum Requirements

A Windows or Unix-like (includes Linux, *BSD and OS X) operating system
If you need a GUI: OpenGL capability (loads of RAM and a fast processor will speed up a bit)
Dependencies

    * Python > 2.3.0 (actually we prefer 3.3)
    * Numeric Python > 22.0
      we use numpy, not the newer numarray.
      recent versions of PyOpenGL need numarray, so if you got problems with Numeric, just install both numpy & numarray.
    * PyOpenGL > 2.0.1.0
      On Windows, you need OpenGL and GLUT.
      You can get a GLUT DLL from the Nate Robins homepage. (?)
      Install the DLL (after extracting from a zip file) into you \$WIN\System\ folder.

Installation
=============

Download the right package somewhere.
Extract it. You can do this with

gunzip packagename
tar -xf packagename

change directory to the new folder
run it by calling "./wesen" (as user)
report the dirty bugs to us ;-)
